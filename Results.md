# Methods :

The experiment records few parameters from movie recommender and two other online recommenders(pick a movie and Suggestmemovie) available on the internet :

Parameters used:

1) Usability

2) User interface 

3) The relevance of recommendations

4) Response Time

5) Quality of Recommendations, 

6) Would you use this tool in the future?

7) Would you recommend this to your friends

8) Overall Experience

9) How many movies liked out of 10 movie recommendations

By visualizing these parameters, we intend to determine the correlation among these parameters and eliminate the least significant parameters. This could help in determining what affects the user and how can the features be improved to make the tool better.

# Materials:

We have used google sheets and tokens to anonymously collect data from the subjects. The test subjects will fille their details in a table. They then pick a key from the available keys in another table and checks the corresponding checkbox.

In this way, we collect the test subjectsâ€™ details and protect their anonymity by not recording the keys picked by them. They can then use these keys to record their results.

## Following is the google spreadsheet we used :
